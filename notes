supertest --- Enables testing Http (kinda like axios)

cross-env --  Runs scripts that set and use environment variables across variables.

knex --env=testing  migrate:latest ----> tells where you want to migrate from


Setting up Heroku

1. In Heroku create App
2. connect to github
3. Choose repo
4. Choose Branch
5. In our project npm i pg (adds to dependencies)
6. Push to repo
7. heroku logs --tail -a (app-name)  shows as it builds
8.  Since Heroku doesnt look at the .env it uses the db-config.js to see the environemnt (in this case its development)
9.  In Heroku to create a Postgres db go to resources and add-on Heroku Postgres.(creates DB server for us)
10. Go to settings Config Vars  and create another environemnt variable called production.  
11. Now in our heroku (via the command line in terminal) we need to migrate our database:
    heroku run knex migrate:latest -a (heroku app name)
12.Then run seeds with:
    heroku run knex seed:run -a (heroku app name)
